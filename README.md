I have Interest towards Creating WEB-APPLICATIONS so before starting this i could have zero knowledge on where to start and what to start?

I came to know javaScript is now in booming and used everywhere, I have core knowlege on Java and oops concepts and little knowlege on html,css and java script

I know all these but dono how to make use of them to create a complete web application.

I tried watching videos and going through materials and blogs, but not able to understand the way to start and create a application on my own.Because if one want create an application fully they need to have knowledge on many technologies is the only thing i knew.

Later i came to know that there is a certain procedure in this...we need to have knowlege on front-end technolgies , Back-end technologies and Data handling techniques such as CURD techniques,creating and designing API's andIntegrating them with both frontend and backend etc...

Then I took reference of a Channel and started towards my Intrest :)

Here i am creating a simple Ecommerce web application in Reactjs.

# WebApplication-Reactjs!!!!

# Pre requisites of creating a reactjs app:

1.Node installed on your computer. You can download Node at "nodejs.org." Create React App requires a Node version of at least 10.
2.A package manager called "npm". It is automatically included in your installation of Node. You need to have an npm version of at least 5.2.
3.A good code editor to work with our project files. I highly recommend using the editor Visual Studio Code. You can grab it at "code.visualstudio.com."

# creating reactjs app!!!

1.open cmd prompt and type node --version u can see the version
