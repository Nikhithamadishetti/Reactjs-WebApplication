I have Interest towards Creating WEB-APPLICATIONS so before starting this i could have zero knowledge on where to start and what to start?

I came to know javaScript is now in booming and used everywhere, I have core knowlege on Java and oops concepts and little knowlege on html,css and java script

I know all these but dono how to make use of them to create a complete web application.

I tried watching videos and going through materials and blogs, but not able to understand the way to start and create a application on my own.Because if one want create an application fully he need have knowledge on many things the only thing i knew.

Later i came to know that there is certain procedure in this...we need to have knowlege on front-end technolgies , Back-end technologies and Data handling techniques such as CURD techniques,creating and designing API's andIntegrating them with both frontend and backend etc...

Then I took reference of a Channel and started towards my Intrest :)
